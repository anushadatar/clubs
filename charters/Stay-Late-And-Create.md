# Stay Late and Create
[Last Modified 2019-09-05]

## Purpose
The goal of SLAC is to provide a chill and inclusive venue with resources, empowerment, and support for community learning and personal projects.

## Membership
SLAC is an open club with all members invited to organize small seminars or courses and to participate in organizational discussions. By virtue of being a student, faculty member, or staff of Olin College, you are a member of SLAC. 

## Officers and Roles
SLAC follows a loose organizational structure relying on volunteerism and goodwill of general members and attendees to keep events happening and sustainable, under the leadership of the SLAC Board of Trustees (SBoT), headed by the Chief of SLAC (CoS). Members of the SBoT are in charge of the mailing list, discussing and making major decisions, and appropriating tasks between members of the council for logistical items like purchases, event organization, or advertisement. 

In addition to overseeing the SBoT, it is the job of the CoS to guide and promote the general sustainability of the organization– finding good sources of funding, fostering and guiding relationships among the college’s staff and faculty, and maintaining detailed documentation of what has worked in the past, and what could be improved.

## Transition Protocol
The CoS must transfer all major responsibilities and decision-making power to a younger student (from the SBoT) prior to their last semester, preferably before then. This will ensure that the organization will continue to exist and thrive throughout the turnover of CoSes. 

## Club Materials, Purchases, and Space
SLAC provides snacks during weekly meetings and occasionally will purchase equipment for use on club projects and peer-led seminars - this will be stored (with the permission of the librarians) in a few bins in the library workroom. Most SLAC-sponsored events will be held in the library. Additional purchases will be made for the annual festival of creativity, SLACFest, and SLAC will apply for additional funding for this event. 

## Events and Activities
SLAC meets weekly to provide a venue for personal project work, tutorials and talks, as well as open-ended discussions of a wide variety of subjects. SLAC also serves as a central meeting place for several other clubs’ events and activities weekly. In addition to weekly meetings, SLAC also hosts an annual festival of creativity, SLACfest. The final area of focus of SLAC is the goal of working with other clubs and organizations to help put on events. 

## Proposed Budget
SLAC spends approximately one hundred (100) dollars each week on food and activities for each evening event. Because there are approximately twenty-five (25) SLAC nights each year, a budget of $2500 would allow SLAC to best serve the entire F. W. Olin FamilyTM. SLAC buys food in bulk, spends as responsibly as possible, and asks companies that come to recruit at SLAC to provide some of the food for the evening in order to minimize costs. 

## Amendment Procedures
The charter can be changed at any time with a quorum of the SBoT.
